# What is array?

>- Array is a collection of objects stored in heap memory. An array should have same data types in it

```
Syntax

int [] arr = new int[size of array]

#int defines the data type [] -> is an array, new is a keyboard of making objects or say initializing objects 


```

> 2D array which also known as 2 dimensional array in which array is stored in rows and columns
> 
```
#syntax

int[][] arr = new int[size of rows][size  of column]

#size of row must be define but column


```

> Let's say we created a 2D array like

int arr[][][] = {1,2,3},
         {4,5,6},
         {7,8,9};
```
#Now here it's working like int arr[][]=[a,b,c] where a={1,2,3} and b={4,5,6} and so on 
```
