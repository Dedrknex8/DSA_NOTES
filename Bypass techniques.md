We can bypass Input field

>Supposed we have website with email address and phone number what if we try to update email address  without '@' symbol it will now accept or try to put numbers in it ..

this can be bypassed  if basic filteration is not applied to the site for instance anyone with inspect tool open the site and try to update the ' value > == $0 '

all we can do is try  to update it with value = "anything we want" > == $0

```python

yes this consider as bug and have seen companies  this bounty like $75 to 100 buck if u're lucky enough
```


with error one try to bypass this and examine it core value to this healt program and applies  this to your site and make sure to get this command useful
