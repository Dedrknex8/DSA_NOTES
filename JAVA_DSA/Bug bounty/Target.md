### XSS Vulnerability Report

**Title:** Reflected XSS Vulnerability in `http://ably.com./`

**Summary:** A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `http://ably.com.tw` website. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which is executed in the context of the victimâ€™s browser. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.

**Vulnerability Details:**

- **URL Affected:** `http://www.ably.com.tw/pdt/vpics.asp?url=`
- **Parameter Affected:** `url`
- **Vulnerability Type:** Reflected XSS

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. **Navigate to the following URL:**
    
    
    `http://www.ably.com.tw/pdt/vpics.asp?url=%3Cimg%20src=foo.png%20onerror=alert(/xssed/)%20/%3E`
    
2. **Observe the following behavior:**
    
    - A JavaScript `alert` with the text "xssed" will be displayed in the browser, confirming that the input is being executed as script code.
  3. Payload used
      <img src=foo.png onerror=alert(/xssed/) />


**Impact:**

- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies or tokens.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website.
- **Content Modification:** The attacker can modify the content of the page to mislead users.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information from the victim.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

1. **Sanitize User Input:**
    
    - Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized before processing. Remove or escape characters that could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
2. **Encode Output:**
    
    - Encode all user-supplied data before rendering it in the browser. Use HTML entity encoding for special characters.
3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    
    - Use a CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.
4. **Use Security Headers:**
    
    - Ensure that HTTP headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` are correctly configured.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Include a screenshot or video of the XSS alert, showing the vulnerability in action.

**Severity:**  High
